principal = 10000 # Principal is a variable which holds the value of principal amount
rateOfInterest = 5 #Rate of interest holds the value of interest rate
time = 3 #Time contains the value of time in yeras
simpleInterest =(principal * rateOfInterest * time) / 100 #Now put the formula of simple interest
print("The Simple Interest is: ", simpleInterest) #Print the value of simple interest
